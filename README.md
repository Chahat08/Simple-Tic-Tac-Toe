# Simple-Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a very basic version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game.<br>
Easy to understand for beginners!<br>
This program uses a simple array to hold the values in each cell of the board. The board itself is made out of unicode characters.<br>
The program also makes 'smart' moves based on its human opponent's choices.<br>
One can also make it easier for the human player to win by commenting out the call to the smartMove function within the computerMove function (line 198 of tic tac toe.cpp), and uncommenting the call to the rand() function (line 197 of tic tac toe.cpp); in which case the program randomly chooses any cell to make its move.<br><br>
A tic-tac-toe game is one of the best places for a beginner to go to when learning a new programming language. This game is made keeping the very beginners in mind. It uses minimal concepts of OOPs, so even C programmers dipping their feet into C++ can easily understand it.<br>
Feedback is appreciated! Hope you enjoy it!
